# Quick Start Guide - AI Agent System

## What Has Been Created

A complete multi-agent system for managing your SuperPrompt Framework GitHub repository has been set up in the `.cursor/agents/` directory.

## Agent Team Overview

You now have **6 AI agents** working together:

1. **Orchestrator** - Coordinates all other agents
2. **Concierge** - Welcomes and supports new contributors
3. **Triage** - Categorizes and prioritizes issues
4. **Lifecycle** - Manages PR validation and code review
5. **Scribe** - Maintains documentation
6. **Community** - Monitors community health

```

## Each Agent Has

1. **instructions.md** - Detailed operational instructions
2. **rules.md** - Strict rules and constraints
3. **context/** - Collaboration and awareness documentation

## Key Features

### For Each Agent:
- ✅ Clear mandate and responsibilities
- ✅ Defined triggers and actions
- ✅ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) protocols
- ✅ Collaboration awareness with other agents
- ✅ Success metrics (KPIs)
- ✅ Error handling procedures

### System-Wide:
- ✅ Guiding principles (5 core principles)
- ✅ Communication protocols (JSON message format)
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Audit trail logging
- ✅ Security by design
- ✅ Attribution and transparency

## Agent Commands

Contributors and maintainers can use these commands:

- `/agent find-gfi` - Mark issue as good first issue (maintainer only)
- `/agent summarize` - Generate PR summary
- `/agent draft-docs` - Generate documentation draft
- `/agent fix this` - Attempt autonomous bug fix (requires approval)

## Important Constraints

### What Agents CAN Do:
- Label issues and PRs (with confidence thresholds)
- Post comments and suggestions
- Trigger CI/CD workflows
- Generate code and documentation drafts
- Welcome new contributors
- Monitor community health

### What Agents CANNOT Do:
- ❌ Merge pull requests (always human decision)
- ❌ Close issues without approval
- ❌ Make architectural decisions
- ❌ Override human maintainers
- ❌ Publicly call out Code of Conduct violations

## Next Steps

### 1. Review the Documentation
Start with: `.cursor/agents/README.md`

### 2. Understand Guiding Principles
Read: `.cursor/shared-context/guiding-principles.md`

### 3. Review Each Agent
Browse each agent's `instructions.md` to understand their role.

### 4. Configure for Your Needs
Adjust confidence thresholds and timeouts in each agent's instructions.

### 5. Set Up GitHub Integration
- Configure webhooks to trigger agent workflows
- Set up GitHub Secrets for credentials
- Configure CI/CD integration

### 6. Test the System
- Create test issues to see Triage Agent in action
- Open test PRs to see Lifecycle Agent working
- Welcome new contributors with Concierge Agent

## Key Principles

All agents follow these 5 principles:

1. **Augmentation over Automation** - Help humans, don't replace them
2. **Radical Transparency** - Log everything publicly
3. **Community Over Code** - Community health comes first
4. **Secure by Design** - Security at every layer
5. **Meritocratic and Fair** - Transparent attribution

## Agent Coordination

```
GitHub Event → Orchestrator → Delegates to Specialized Agent(s)
                    ↑                          ↓
                    └───── Reports Back ───────┘
```

All agents are aware of each other and coordinate through the Orchestrator.

## Monitoring

### Audit Trail
All agent actions are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Agent name and version
- Action taken
- Rationale and confidence score

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
Track these metrics to measure agent effectiveness:
- Time to triage: <15 minutes
- PR cycle time: <43 hours (40% reduction target)
- New contributor retention: 15% (50% increase target)
- Community sentiment: >85% positive

## Emergency Stop

Apply `AI-PAUSE` label to any issue, PR, or repository to immediately halt all agent activity.
